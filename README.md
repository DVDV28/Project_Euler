Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that usually require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This repository is designed to help me showcase my skills in R, Python, mathematics and problem solving. It should be noted that my primary language is R and that the Python programming here is primarily to improve my fluency in a second language.
